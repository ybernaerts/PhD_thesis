# PhD_thesis
This repo contains raw data, preprocessed data, code and figures belonging to my PhD thesis. It also contains the latex code based on the [kaobook template](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook) with which the pdf can be rendered.

## Data
Some raw electrophysiological recordings in `.nwb` format can be found in `data/raw_data/`. They serve as exemplary cells to illustrate some of the results. All raw electrophysiological recordings that have been used in multiple studies that make up the bulk of this thesis can be found on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000008/draft).
<br>
Most of the preprocessed data is in `/data/`. Yet some files are too big for upload on GitHub. These include:
1. full_batch.npz that can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7716391).
2. SmartSeq_cells_AIBS.pickle that also can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5118962#.Y-IkqHbMIuU).
Please put those 2 files in `/data/` if you consider to work with the code.

## Code
Small analyses and figures have been produced with code in the main directory.

## Figures
In `figures/`, you can find most figures (not including sketches) that are included in the thesis.
