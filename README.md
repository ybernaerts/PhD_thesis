# PhD_thesis
This repo contains raw data, preprocessed data, code and figures belonging to my PhD thesis. It also contains the latex code based on the [kaobook template](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook) with which the pdf can be rendered.
<br>

### Data
Some raw electrophysiological recordings in `.nwb` format can be found in `data/raw_data/`. They serve as exemplary cells to illustrate some of the results.
<br>
Most of the preprocessed data is in `/data/`. Yet some files are too big for upload on GitHub. These include:
1. full_batch.npz that can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7716391).
2. SmartSeq_cells_AIBS.pickle can also be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5118962#.Y-IkqHbMIuU).
Please put those 2 files in `/data/` if you consider to work with the code.

### Code
Small analyses and figures have been produced with code in the main directory.
<br>



### Figures
In `figures/`, you can find most figures (not including sketches) that are included in the thesis.
